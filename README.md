# Day Planner

## Description

Everybody organises their life via an online calendar these days. This application is a simple calendar that allows one to save events for each hour of the day, which are colour coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. In the making of this application I was able to practice how to dynamically update HTML and use jQuery to power my CSS.

To open and access this project on your personal device, you can download an IDE of your choice but we recommend Visual Studio Code.

After downloading the IDE of your choice you will have access to the raw code. However to host the webpage locally, you will need to download an extension that allows you to open it into your default browser or in your IDE. I recommend Liveserver:

Then using this type of extension, right clicking the file and pressing "Open with Live Server" allows you to open the webpage in your default browser and check out the project from your own device.

## Usage

Below is what the application looks like:

To plan your day, all you have to do is simply type into the text area and click the blue save button on the right. Once saved, you can refresh and revisit the page as many times as you'd like and your schedule will still be the same due to your information being saved to local storage.

If you want to reset your schedule, you can press the red 'Clear' button at the bottom of the page.
